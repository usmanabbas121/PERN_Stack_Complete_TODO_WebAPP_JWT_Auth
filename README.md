# PERN_Stack_Complete_TODO_WebAPP_JWT_Auth

Here is the complete code for the complete PERN Stack TODO App with User Registration, Login, Dashboard, CRUD operations for TODO tasks and JWT Authentication and Authorization,
made from scratch. Token is stored in local storage for session management. 
In the application, I merged all the modules, e.g JWT Auth and Todos App modules. TODO app module is merged and render in place of Dashboard.
Moreover, bcrypt is applied for password encryption.Also, I have Added some middlewares for token authentication, authorization and validation of credentials and token. 
There is also a middle ware specially added to authenticate token. Token also gets authenticated on page refresh. Logout functioality is also added. 
Toasts are also added to notify the user about the events.
I have learnt how to combine these technologies to build a full-stack web application and I have shared the complete code in this repository.
Anyone who wants to learn PERN Stack specially with the usage of JWT, may clone this git repo as the code is completely refined and understanable
and Yes, Comments are also specially added for understanding.

Happy Coding! üòç ~Usman Abbas
